## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
People seem to love movie review sites, so you have lots of potential users. I think this could be fun and give you plenty of opportunity to show off your skills.

### Scope of work
The overall scope seems reasonable, but you need to separate your MVP features from your stretch-goal features. This is not only useful to make sure you have something that works on the project due date, but, more importantly, it will help you all to focus on the most important things first.

### Docs
The start on your docs looks good. For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
