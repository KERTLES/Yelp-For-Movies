Today my partner and I decided to work on the signup for the views.py. We reference the api_views for the conference go and I went on Bootstrap as well to find html for our react page. We got our containers to run and ran migrations for our models, and we finished it off by adding CORSHEADERS in our settings as well as adjusting the installed apps and the middleware.

Today my partner and I continued to work on the signup page on the front end side. We managed to get format the Bootstrap html that we found for a signup correctly and we also configured it to be fully functional, as inputting the data when creating account we would see the console.log show up on the terminal. We then began focusing on converting the react page into smaller pieces potentially using react hooks.

Today I continued work on the sign up page. We referenced the learn module when it came to authentication and were able to set up an authentication token users to be able to login and logout. However, we have reached a block where my partner and I are trying to figure out how to show whether the person is logged in or not, giving the user special privileges on being able to access certain tabs on the dropdown menu, for example, if the user is logged in, they would be able to sign out as well as have access to the create a review or my reviews, whereas a person that is not logged in wouldn't have access do it. I reckon going back into previous projects would give me insight into how to set that up.

Today I continued working on the login page. I referenced from the learn module and used code from the Authentication which set up the login.js. I am still trying to go about how to link the login feature with the accounts as well. and I believe I need to at a function within our signup feature and make some changes for our app.js
