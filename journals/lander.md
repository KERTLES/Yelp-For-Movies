Today my partner and I decided to work on the signup for the views.py. We reference the api_views for the conference go and I went on Bootstrap as well to find html for our react page. We got our containers to run and ran migrations for our models, and we finished it off by adding CORSHEADERS in our settings as well as adjusting the installed apps and the middleware.

Today my partner and I continued to work on the signup page on the front end side. We managed to get format the Bootstrap html that we found for a signup correctly and we also configured it to be fully functional, as inputting the data when creating account we would see the console.log show up on the terminal. We then began focusing on converting the react page into smaller pieces potentially using react hooks.
