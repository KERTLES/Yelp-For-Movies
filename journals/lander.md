Today my partner and I decided to work on the signup for the views.py. We reference the api_views for the conference go and I went on Bootstrap as well to find html for our react page. We got our containers to run and ran migrations for our models, and we finished it off by adding CORSHEADERS in our settings as well as adjusting the installed apps and the middleware.
