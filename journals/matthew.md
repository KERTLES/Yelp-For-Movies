    Today we set up our Django, docker environment and react for the project so that we are ready to start coding. 
    We also did a little bit of break down of what suggestions we were given about how we should implement our code.

    Today we made our first models and views in the accounts microservice.
    Made it so that it also creates new users within the Django authorization system.
    Tested it with Insomnia to be sure that the back-end works.
    Fixed some issues with docker not loading certain containers.

    Today, we worked on the getting the sign up react page functional.
    We made sure that submitting a form resulted in the proper creation of an account and User.
    We also made it so that it tells a user that a password, email, or username has already been used and that they need to input new ones.
    Also, we implemented a rudimentary double password authentication system that only shows the register button if the same password has been input twice.
