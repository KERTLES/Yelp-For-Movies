    Today we set up our Django, docker environment and react for the project so that we are ready to start coding. 
    We also did a little bit of break down of what suggestions we were given about how we should implement our code.

    Today we made our first models and views in the accounts microservice.
    Made it so that it also creates new users within the Django authorization system.
    Tested it with Insomnia to be sure that the back-end works.
    Fixed some issues with docker not loading certain containers.
